Instructions
============

Put flowers in a garden given garden layout and flower details

Garden File
===========
Garden layout with possible planting locations. Walls are 'X' and free spots as ' '. e.g.

XXXXXXXXXX
X      XXX
X X   XXXX
X     XXXX
X     XX X
XXXXXXXXXX

There are 21 possible positions where a flower can be planted.


Flower File
===========
Each line containing a tuple of flower type, number of flowers to plant of that type, and a constraint on minimum distance between two flowers of that type.e.g.
a,3,1
b,2,2
c,2,2
d,2,5

This should be interpreted as:
3 flowers of type 'a' should be planted - the minimum distance is 1 (so these can be placed next to each other)
2 flowers of type 'b' should be planted - the minimum distance is 2 (so all 'b' flowers must have at least distance 2 to all other 'b' flowers)
2 flowers of type 'c' should be planted - the minimum distance is 2
2 flowers of type 'd' should be planted - the minimum distance is 5

Use the manhattan distance (vertical distance + horizontal distance).


Example Output
==============
One possible solution is:

XXXXXXXXXX
Xaaa  dXXX
XbXb  XXXX
X c   XXXX
Xc    XXdX
XXXXXXXXXX
